High Level Architecture
* Dedicated authoritative server
* All game logic will be processed on the server
   * Server will screen shot the current game state then send the image over a UDP channel, streaming the game state to the client
   * Initial version will use Application.CaptureScreenshot to capture a PNG
      * Final version may use custom screen capture script with JPG format for faster processing speeds
   * Image is converted to a byte array, time stamped, and sent across the network
   * Images are rendered to the client as soon as they arrive, unless the time stamp on the image pre-dates the last rendered image
   * Server will send additional messages to control audio cues, which are then processed by the client
* Thin Client                
   * Inputs received by the client are written to a message which is converted to a byte array                        
      * This byte array is send to the server over a UDP channel for processing
* Persistent User Information
   * User data will be stored in a MySQL database
      * Stored data will consist of a username and password
   * When a user logs in, their information will be compared to the SQL database
      * Matching information results in a successful login
      * No match will create the specified username / password for the user
